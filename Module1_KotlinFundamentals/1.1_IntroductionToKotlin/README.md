## ✅ Notes

### 🕰️ Kotlin History

- **2011** – Kotlin developed by JetBrains (creators of IntelliJ IDEA)
- **Feb 2016** – Kotlin project officially announced
- **2016** – Kotlin v1.0 released
- **May 2017** – Google announced Kotlin as an official Android language
- **May 2019** – Google made Kotlin the preferred language for Android development

### ✨ Kotlin Features (with examples)

#### ✅ Concise Syntax
Kotlin reduces boilerplate code compared to Java:
```kotlin
val name = "Teja" // Declares an immutable variable with type inference

✅ Null Safety

Avoids NullPointerException with nullable types and safe calls:

var name: String? = null
println(name?.length) // Safe call operator

✅ Extension Functions

Add new functionality to existing classes without inheritance:

fun String.firstChar(): Char = this[0]
println("Kotlin".firstChar()) // Output: K

🤔 What Are Coroutines in Kotlin?

Coroutines allow you to write asynchronous, non-blocking code in a simple and sequential way — without complex callbacks or managing threads manually.
🧠 Why Use Coroutines?

Because operations like:

    ✅ API calls

    ✅ Database access

    ✅ File I/O

    ✅ Timers and delays

...are slow and can freeze the app if run on the main thread.
🛠️ Benefits of Coroutines:

    Asynchronous by default

    Keeps code clean and readable

    Avoids callback hell

    Structured concurrency for managing background tasks

📍 Where Can You Use Coroutines?

    Android:

        API requests (e.g., Retrofit)

        Database (e.g., Room)

        Background tasks (viewModelScope, lifecycleScope)

    Backend:

        Parallel processing

        Handling high traffic with non-blocking calls

    Standalone Kotlin/Java apps:

        Concurrent operations

        Simple async logic

🧪 Coroutine Example:
// In Activity/Fragment
lifecycleScope.launch {
    delay(1000)
    updateUI()
}

What it does:

    Launches a coroutine in the lifecycle scope

    Waits 1 second (non-blocking delay)

    Calls updateUI() after delay

Use viewModelScope in ViewModels for lifecycle-aware background tasks.
🧠 Smart Casts & Type Inference
✅ Smart Casts

Kotlin automatically casts types after checking with is.
fun demo(x: Any) {
    if (x is String) {
        println(x.length) // Smart cast: no manual cast needed
    }
}

Example usage:
demo("Hello Kotlin")
demo(1234) // Will not enter the if-block

🛠️ Setting Up Kotlin in Android Studio
✅ Prerequisite

    Android Studio installed (latest version recommended)

Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Create a New Android Project

    Open Android Studio

    Click New Project

    Select Empty Activity

    Click Next

Step 2: Configure Your Project

    Name: MyFirstKotlinApp

    Language: Kotlin ✅

    Minimum SDK: API 21 or higher

    Click Finish

Step 3: Project Structure
MainActivity.kt is generated automatically:

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        println("Hello from Kotlin!") // Prints to Logcat
    }
}

Step 4: Run the App

    Connect a device or emulator

    Click Run ▶️

    App installs and displays your greeting

✅ You now have a working Kotlin-based Android app!
